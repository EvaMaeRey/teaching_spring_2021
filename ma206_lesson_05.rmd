# Agenda

- Housekeeping

  - record the session!
  - Wiley plus instructor points... 50 points
  - instructor bonus points...
  - remaining 25 instructor points

---

# Homework - Try for friday (or email - 'I'm stuck')

- New instructor points - submit "knit" html document (or let me know you need help, by midnight Friday) 
- data manipulation
- data visualization

---

# Exploration exercise #1 - Due by start of lesson six! Monday

> Wiley not-so-good answer:  "The chance model is wrong"

> Wiley answer correction:  "There is strong evidence against the chance model" **or** "The observed data is quite inconsistent with the chance model"

Is that possible?

Is it probable? Is it likely?

# Could getting 15 out of 16 fish have happen just by chance?  

p-value - *Exactly* how likely to see that extreme or more extreme if chance generated the outcome


"this would only happen 1 in 1000 based on a chance model" 
--
p-value 
--
= 1/1000 
--
= .001

---

# p-value: How often 
--
(the proportion of the time) 
--
we would see an outcome 
--
as extreme 
--
or more extreme 
--
than what is observed 
--
if the null (chance model) is true.


---

# Notation

## Null Hypothesis (Chance) $$ H_0 $$ 


--

## If evidence is strong against, 
--
then we can 
--
**reject the null**,
-- 
$H_0$, 
--
and accept the alternative hypothesis 
--
$H_A$




---

## Alternatively, we can calculate a "z score" to talk about being extreme from what's seen under chance.



## How far away from the chance model center?

--

## Measure...


--

### in fish?

--

### in standard deviations! 

--

### z is a *standardized statistic*



---

# Calculating the Z statistic

z = observed - average of chance model / standard deviation

#### Interpretation




---

# The applet!

-  1. Null: There is an equal distribution of classes years (Plebe, Yuk, Cow, Firstie) in MA206 - (prop = .25)

-  2. Null: There is a fifty-fifty chance of an MA206 student liking chocolate-containing candy as favorite.

-  3. Book exercise:  Who's more the more successful politician - do people lean one way? Or from our poll, do we observe something consistent with chance.

Next session: 

Central limit theorem, normal distribution, and assumptions of the theory based approach.
