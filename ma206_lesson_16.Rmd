calculate the difference in proportions between groups $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$

### Step 1: *statistic* 
--
calculate the difference in proportions between groups $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$

observe and collect might-have-been $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ differences in proportions observed by chance through simulation

### Step 1: *statistic* 
--
calculate the difference in proportions between groups $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ 

--

### Step 2: *simulate* 
--
observe and collect might-have-been $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ differences in proportions observed by chance through simulation

### Step 3: *strength of the evidence (against null)*
--
Answer the question: Is observed (Step 1) consistent with what's we expect under chance (Step 2)? Or inconsistent? p-value is the probability of observing as extreme (or more extreme) just by chance
