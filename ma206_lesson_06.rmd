# Could getting 15 out of 16 fish have happen just by chance?  

p-value - *Exactly* how likely to see that extreme or more extreme if chance generated the outcome


"this would only happen 1 in 1000 based on a chance model" 
--
pvalue = 1/1000 = .001

---

# p-value: How often 
--
(the proportion of the time) 
--
we would see an outcome 
--
as extreme 
--
or more extreme 
--
than what is observed 
--
if the null (chance model) is true.


---

# Notation

## Null Hypothesis (Chance) $$ H_0 $$ 


--

## If evidence is strong against, 
--
then we can 
--
**reject the null** 
--
and accept the alternative hypothesis 
--
$$H_A$$




---

## Alternatively, we can "z score" to talk about being extreme from what's seen under chance.



## How far away from the chance model center?

--

## Measure...


--

### in fish?

--

### in standard deviations! 

--

### z is a *standardized* statistic



---

# Calculating the Z statistic - for the One-proportion z test

z = (observed - average of chance model) / standard deviation

# Can I also calculate a p-value with the z-score?

--

z-score seems imprecise.  I want to know: *exactly* how unlikely to observe such extreme a case just by chance


---

# Theory-based test for a single proportion 

--

or

# 'one-proportion z-test'

---

# Relies on

the Central Limit Theorem

> If the sample size (n) is large enough, sampling distributions are normally distributed...

# The Central Limit Theorem for proportions ->

> The distribution of sample proportions will be bell-shaped (normal), centered at the long-run proportion (pi), with a standard deviation of: 

# $$ sd_{prop} = \sqrt\frac{\pi*(1-\pi)}{n} $$

# Step 1 calculate sample proportion

```{r, echo = T}

## Step 2 calc sd for the null:

```{r, echo = T}
sqrt((.25 * (1-.25)) / 15 )
```

# Step 3 calc z stat

## z stat (number of SDs away from chance model mean)

```{r, echo = T}

0.1118034
