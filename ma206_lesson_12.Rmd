Note on Exploration Exercise 2:



```{r, echo = T}
prop.test(x = 99, # observed successes
          n = 100, # num observations
          p = .5, # parameter, pi for null
          correct = F
          )

# Confidence interval formal definition

--

The 95% confidence interval is the interval that will encompass the population parameter, 95 in 100 times when calculated for repeated samples.

---

Usually we just have one sample.  

--

If I calculate the 95% confidence interval for my single sample, the true mean probably lies in that interval, but I must acknowledge I might have, by chance, on of the "bad samples" -- the 5 in 100 times when my interval doesn't encompass the true population mean.

Causal relationships?
--
Does movement in one variable *cause* movement in another?
--
When we visualize what does X usually imply, what does y position imply?

# Frost Poem

---

.pull-left[Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;]

.pull-right[Then took the other, as **just as fair,**
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
**Though as for that the passing there**
**Had worn them really about the same,**]

---

.pull-left[And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.]

.pull-right[**I shall be telling this with a sigh**
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.]

*The two paths might not be that different - have given the same result.*


--

*Nagging question: I know what I'll probably be saying in the future, but will it really be true?  Has taking that particular road it really made a difference?*

- Poem's final lines are often interpreted as triumphant:  the decision was a very consequential one."

but 

- "Frost liked to warn listeners (and readers) that 'you have to be careful of that one; it’s a tricky poem—very tricky.'" https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/89511/robert-frost-the-road-not-taken

# Fundamental problem of causal inference

We can't observe O|T and O|C

Gold standard for causal inference: 
 - Randomized Control Trials






---

# What comparisons do I *want* to make?

*Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?* (Shakespeare Sonnet 18)



---

Same unit to itself - treated and control (untreated)

$BloodPressure_(Joe) | drug$ and $BloodPressure_(Joe) | placebo$

What is the treatment effect:

--
$(BloodPressure_(Joe) | drug) - $
$(BloodPressure_(Joe) | placebo)$


---
# Fundamental problem of causal inference

"It is impossible to observe the effect of more than one treatment on a subject at one time. Joe cannot both take the pill and not take the pill at the same time."


--

(Just as the traveler in the poem cannot take both paths!)

Some paths to correlation: 

- causation

--

- spuriousness (confounding)

--

- reverse causation

--

- chance

---
# Beyond correlation:  randomized control trials and causal inference

RCT - Randomized control trial. 
--
The **gold standard** for causal inference

--
Let's us compare averages of groups of people (observational units) -- each of which has equal opportunity to be in the control or treatment group.
